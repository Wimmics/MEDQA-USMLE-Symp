A 36-year-old nulligravid woman with primary infertility comes for a follow-up examination. She has been unable to conceive for 10 years; analysis of her husband's semen during this period has shown normal sperm counts. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days. She is asymptomatic except for severe dysmenorrhea. An endometrial biopsy specimen 5 days before menses shows secretory endometrium. Hysterosalpingography 1 year ago showed normal findings. Pelvic examination shows a normal vagina and cervix. Bimanual examination shows a normal-sized uterus and no palpable adnexal masses. Rectal examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
