A 29-year-old woman is hospitalized due to depression and suicidal ideation. She has a 5-year history of chaotic relationships that last only a few short weeks or months. Each relationship has left her feeling abandoned, empty, and extremely upset. During these periods, the patient confesses to shopping and making big purchases on impulse. She says she gets bored easily and moves on to the next adventure. The patient denies any changes in appetite, energy level, or concentration. On examination, multiple linear lacerations of varying phases of healing were noted on her forearms and trunk. Following consultation, she praises physicians to be ‘the best people on the planet’, but when the nurse came in to take her blood, she furiously stated that ‘all nurses are incompetent and cruel’. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
