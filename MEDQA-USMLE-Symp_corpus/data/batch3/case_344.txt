A 17-year-old boy comes to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of pain in his left wrist. That morning the pain increased and he started to have chills and malaise. Last week he had self-resolving left knee pain. He is otherwise healthy and has not had any trauma to the wrist. He recently returned from a camping trip to Minnesota. He is sexually active with one female partner, who uses a diaphragm for contraception. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F). Examination shows several painless violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on the dorsum of both wrists and hands; two lesions are present on the left palm. There is swelling and erythema of the left wrist with severe tenderness to palpation and passive movement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
