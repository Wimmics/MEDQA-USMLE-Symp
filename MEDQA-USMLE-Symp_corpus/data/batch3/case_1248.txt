Upon arriving, the patient’s symptoms have resolved. He states his symptoms occurred as he was going to bed. He has never experienced this before, but felt extremely dizzy for roughly 3 minutes. He currently feels at his baseline. The patient is otherwise healthy and only has a history of eczema. His temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 134/85 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a healthy man with a normal gait. The patient has a physiologic nystagmus and his cranial nerve exam is unremarkable.
