A 23-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her boyfriend because of a 4-month history of feeling sad. Her boyfriend says that, during this period, she has slept and eaten very little and has been unable to focus at work. She says that she feels “empty inside” and has been hearing voices telling her that she is worthless. She first heard these voices 7 months ago when they started to make fun of her. She does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, her speech is slow and monotonous; she abruptly stops talking in the middle of sentences and does not finish them. She occasionally directs her attention to the ceiling as if she were listening to someone. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
