A previously healthy 20-year-old woman comes to the physician because of recurrent abdominal cramps, bloating, and diarrhea for 4 months. She describes her stools as greasy, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush. During this time she has had a 6-kg (13.2-lb) weight loss. She has no personal or family history of serious illness. Physical examination shows pallor and cheilitis. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 11 g/dL. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative and stool microscopy reveals no pathogens and no leukocytes. Analysis of a 24-hour stool sample shows 12 g of fat. The patient is asked to consume 25 g of d-xylose. Five hours later, its concentration is measured in urine at 2 g (N = > 4 g/5 h). The test is repeated after a two-week course of rifaximin, but the urinary concentration of d-xylose remains the same. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
