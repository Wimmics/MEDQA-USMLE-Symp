A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his host parents for evaluation of a progressively pruritic rash over his shoulders and buttocks for the past 6 months. He recently came to the United States from Nigeria to attend a year of high school. He reports that it has been increasingly difficult for him to read the whiteboard during classes. Physical examination shows symmetrically distributed papules 4â€“8 mm in diameter, excoriation marks, and patchy hyperpigmentation over his shoulders, waist, and buttocks. There is nontender inguinal lymphadenopathy and several firm, nontender subcutaneous nodules along the right iliac crest. Six skin snip biopsies are taken from the pelvic girdle, buttocks, and thigh, and are then incubated in saline. After 24 hours, microscopic examination shows motile microfilariae. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
