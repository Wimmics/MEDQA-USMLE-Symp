She says that the blurring has made it difficult to read, although she has noticed that she can read a little better if she holds the book below or above eye level. She also requires a bright light to look at objects. She reports that her symptoms began 8 years ago and have gradually gotten worse over time. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide and lisinopril. When looking at an Amsler grid, she says that the lines in the center appear wavy and bent. An image of her retina, as viewed through fundoscopy is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
