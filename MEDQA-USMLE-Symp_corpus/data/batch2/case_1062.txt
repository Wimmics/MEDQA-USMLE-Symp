A 12-month-old girl is brought in by her mother to the pediatrician for the first time since her 6-month checkup. The mother states that her daughter had been doing fine, but the parents are now concerned that their daughter is still not able to stand up or speak. On exam, the patient has a temperature of 98.5°F (36.9°C), pulse is 96/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mmHg. The child appears to have difficulty supporting herself while sitting. The patient has no other abnormal physical findings. She plays by herself and is making babbling noises but does not respond to her own name. She appears to have some purposeless motions. A previous clinic note documents typical development at her 6-month visit and mentioned that the patient was sitting unsupported at that time. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
