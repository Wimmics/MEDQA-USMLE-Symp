Shortly after undergoing a bipolar prosthesis for a displaced femoral neck fracture of the left hip acquired after a fall the day before, an 80-year-old woman suddenly develops dyspnea. The surgery under general anesthesia with sevoflurane was uneventful, lasting 98 minutes, during which the patient maintained oxygen saturation readings of 96–100% on 8 L of oxygen. She has a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis of her right knee. Her medications include ramipril, naproxen, ranitidine, and a multivitamin. She appears cyanotic, drowsy, and is oriented only to person. Her temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 135/minute, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 155/95 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 81%. There are several scattered petechiae on the anterior chest wall. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 9,000/mm3, a platelet count of 145,000/mm3, and a creatine kinase of 190 U/L. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
