A 56-year-old man comes to the clinic for a check-up. He presents with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. He is a former construction worker, and worked in a steel mill when he was in high school. He is an active smoker with a 36-pack-year smoking history. The blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and the BMI is 31 kg/m2. The patient is afebrile and the oxygen saturation at rest is 95% on room air. The pulmonary examination reveals a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, and no wheezing or crackles are auscultated. A pulmonary function test is recommended for the patient, and 2 weeks later he returns with a report that shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value. The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value, a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, and a DLCO of 60% of predicted value. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
