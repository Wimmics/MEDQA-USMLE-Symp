The mother describes her state as “hyper” and reports that she often paces around her room. During this period, the patient has not slept. She had similar episodes 2 months and 5 months ago. The mother also states that, for the past 8 months, the patient has believed she is a famous singer and is going on a world tour next year.

She has not held a job since then. She does not use illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, her speech is pressured, but she suddenly stops talking in the middle of sentences and does not finish them.
