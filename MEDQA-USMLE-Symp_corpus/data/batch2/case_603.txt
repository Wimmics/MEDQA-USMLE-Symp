She initially thought it was an insect bite, but it has slowly increased in size over the past weeks. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a 0.8-cm hyperpigmented papule. When the skin lesion is squeezed, the surface retracts inwards. A photograph of the lesion is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
