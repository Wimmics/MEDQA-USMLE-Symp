A 21-year-old man comes to the physician because of nervousness and difficulty sleeping over the past 2 weeks. Three months ago, he started a new team project at his job. He says that he has trouble falling asleep at night because he thinks about the project. He insists on checking the work of his teammates and spends several hours each week making elaborate lists and schedules. He refuses to let others take on more tasks because he thinks that only he can complete them satisfactorily. The project deadline has already been postponed once. He says, “My teammates never understand how important it is to do things the right way.” Ever since high school, he has used the majority of his time to plan out assignments and does not have time to regularly participate in social activities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
