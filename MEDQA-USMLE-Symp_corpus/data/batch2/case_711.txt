An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because he has excessively dry skin. His mother says that he has had dry, scaly skin since he was 6 months old. She says it is worse in winter and better in summer. There is no associated itching, redness, or discharge.

There are multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles and darkening of the palmar and plantar creases. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
